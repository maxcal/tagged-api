# Tagged!

Tagged! is open source rental management system for small to tiny companies. The
goal is to be extremely user focused and just enough system.

This is the API component of the project.

One of the main goals is to have a highly mobile friendly interface where QR codes
provide much of the linking between the system and real world entities.

It is a JSON only API which tries to conform the the [JSONAPI](http://jsonapi.org/)
spec.

## Requirements
- Ruby 2.2.2
- Postgresql 9.3+

## Developer Instructions
Just set the app up like any other Rails app.

You can run `spring binstub --all` to speed up your rails commands.
Continous testing is available by running `guard`.
